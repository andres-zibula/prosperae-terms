  <h1>Prosperae – Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> January 12, 2026</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Summary (non‑binding):</strong> Prosperae is a personal finance app. You sign in with Google on Android or Apple on iOS. Your financial data is stored locally on your device. Optional services (analytics and crash reports) can be disabled in the Privacy settings. Premium is offered as an auto‑renewing monthly or yearly subscription managed through the app stores.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
  <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) form a legally binding agreement between you and <strong>Andres Zibula</strong> (“Developer”, “we”, “us”) regarding your use of the Prosperae mobile application and related services (the “App”). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You may use the App only if you can form a binding contract where you live and you comply with applicable laws and the policies of Google Play and/or the Apple App Store.</p>

  <h2>3. Accounts and sign‑in</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Android:</strong> sign‑in is available via Google.</li>
    <li><strong>iOS:</strong> sign‑in is available via Sign in with Apple.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App does not support guest mode or creating a standalone username/password account. Your account identity is managed through Firebase Authentication.</p>

  <h2>4. What the App does (no financial advice)</h2>
  <p>Prosperae helps you record and organize personal finance information (e.g., transactions, accounts, budgets). <strong>The App does not provide financial, legal, tax, or investment advice.</strong> Any insights are informational only. You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the information you enter and for any decisions you make based on the App.</p>

  <h2>5. Your content and local storage</h2>
  <p>Financial information you enter into the App (including currencies and country settings) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. You are responsible for safeguarding your device and maintaining backups if you want to preserve your data. We are not responsible for data loss caused by device issues, OS resets, uninstallations, or user actions.</p>

  <h2>6. Optional telemetry, third‑party services, and feedback</h2>
  <p>The App integrates third‑party services to enable sign‑in, subscriptions, diagnostics, analytics, and optional feedback. Their processing is governed by their own terms and policies.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> used to authenticate users via Google or Apple. It may process a user identifier, email, name, profile photo URL, and provider information (google/apple).</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> used to understand general App usage (e.g., screen views, session events, basic interaction events). It does not log your financial amounts or account names.</li>
    <li><strong>Sentry:</strong> used for crash/error reporting. It may receive diagnostic data such as stack traces, exception messages, app version/build, environment, lifecycle events, and basic device context (e.g., OS version, device model, battery level). We configure our integration to avoid sending personally identifying information in error payloads.</li>
    <li><strong>Firestore (Feedback/Support):</strong> used only when you submit feedback from within the App. In that case, we store your message, timestamp, your user ID and email (to reply), and basic device/app metadata (OS/version, device model, app version, locale).</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> used to manage subscriptions and entitlement status.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Controls:</strong> You can disable Sentry diagnostics and Firebase Analytics in the App’s Privacy settings. If disabled, some diagnostic/usage insights may be unavailable, but core functionality remains.</p>

  <h2>7. Premium subscription</h2>
  <p>Prosperae offers Premium via auto‑renewing subscriptions (monthly and yearly). Subscription management and billing are handled by the applicable app store and RevenueCat.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Auto‑renewal:</strong> subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period (store rules apply).</li>
    <li><strong>Prices and currency:</strong> displayed in the App store checkout and may vary by region and currency.</li>
    <li><strong>No free trial:</strong> unless explicitly shown at purchase time, there is no trial period.</li>
    <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> you can cancel through your Google Play or Apple account subscription settings. Cancellation stops future renewals; access may remain until the end of the paid period.</li>
    <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> refunds are handled by Google Play and/or Apple according to their policies. We do not issue refunds directly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Account deletion</h2>
  <p>You can request deletion of your account and associated cloud‑stored data using the in‑App option in Settings. This deletes your authentication record and related data we store in our cloud services (such as feedback messages). Local financial data on your device may require you to uninstall the App and/or clear local storage depending on your device settings.</p>

  <h2>9. Acceptable use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the App in a way that violates any law, regulation, or store policy.</li>
    <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code except where permitted by law.</li>
    <li>Interfere with the App’s operation, security, or networks; probe or scan for vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Use the App to submit unlawful, harmful, or abusive content, including in feedback messages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Intellectual property</h2>
  <p>The App, including its code, design, and branding, is owned by the Developer and protected by intellectual property laws. These Terms grant you a personal, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non‑commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>11. Updates and changes</h2>
  <p>We may update the App and modify features from time to time. We may also update these Terms. If we make material changes, we will update the “Effective date” above and may provide notice in the App. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>12. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE APP WILL BE ERROR‑FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.</p>

  <h2>13. Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE DEVELOPER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP. IF LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, IT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APP IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM (OR USD $10 IF YOU PAID NOTHING), TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

  <h2>14. Termination</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or if required by law or store policies. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive (e.g., disclaimers, limitation of liability).</p>

  <h2>15. Apple App Store additional terms</h2>
  <p>If you downloaded the App from the Apple App Store:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>These Terms are between you and the Developer, not Apple.</li>
    <li>Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance or support for the App.</li>
    <li>In the event of any failure of the App to conform to applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple may refund the purchase price (if any). To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation.</li>
    <li>Apple is not responsible for addressing claims by you or any third party relating to the App, including product liability, legal compliance, or intellectual property infringement claims.</li>
    <li>You represent that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo and are not on any U.S. Government prohibited or restricted party list.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>16. Governing law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Uruguay</strong>, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Courts located in Uruguay will have jurisdiction over disputes to the extent permitted by law.</p>
