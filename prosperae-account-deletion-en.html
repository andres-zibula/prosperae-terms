    <p>This page explains how to delete your <strong>Prosperae</strong> account and what happens to your data when you do so.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>How to delete your account</h2>

  <h2>What data is deleted</h2>
  <p>When you delete your account, the following data is deleted:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authentication record</strong> (Firebase Authentication), including your user identifier and sign-in provider association.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback/support messages</strong> you submitted from within the app (stored in Firestore), including message content and timestamps.</li>
